# Research Interests

---
I am generally interested in natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML). Current interests include: 

### NLP Applications
- ((hierarchical) multi-label) text classification
- aspect-based sentiment analysis, relation extraction and named entity recognition
- context-based fake news detection / fact-check

### Natural Language Understanding
- low-resource / data-centric / data-efficient NLP
- domain adaptation (unsupervised, generalization, source-free, _etc_) in NLP
- pre-trained language model knowledge transfer

### general Machine Learning
- tranfer learning
- unsupervised learning
